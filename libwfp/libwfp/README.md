# Mullvad libwfp

libwfp is a C++ library for interacting with the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP). Notably, libwfp
provides builders for defining providers, filters and sets of conditions.

## Checking out the code

The code is dependent on one other repository:

* mullvad/windows-libraries

   Specifically, the `libcommon` library contained herein, for general functionality not provided by
   the standard library.

For reasons of flexibility, this repository is not included as a submodule. It is instead
required to be checked out at the same level as libwfp:
```
mkdir libwfp && cd libwfp
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/windows-libraries.git
git clone https://github.com/mullvad/libwfp.git
```

## Development environment

libwfp requires Visual Studio 2019. Any edition will work, e.g. Visual Studio Community 2019 is a
perfectly fine choice.

## Dependencies

For dependencies required during development, see above, section *Checking out the code*.

For deployment there are no external dependencies beyond what is already provided by Windows itself.

libwfp is targeted at Windows 7, 8 and 10.

## Example usage
### Fine-grained blocking of outgoing connections
``` cpp
#include <libwfp/filterengine.h>
#include <libwfp/buildervalidation.h>
#include <libwfp/sublayerbuilder.h>
#include <libwfp/objectinstaller.h>
#include <libwfp/conditionbuilder.h>
#include <libwfp/conditions/conditionapplication.h>
#include <libwfp/conditions/conditionportrange.h>
#include <libwfp/conditions/comparison.h>
#include <libwfp/filterbuilder.h>
#include <memory>

int main()
{
    auto engine = wfp::FilterEngine::DynamicSession();

    wfp::SublayerBuilder sublayer(wfp::BuilderValidation::OnlyCritical);

    sublayer
        .name(L"libwfp example layer")
        .weight(MAXUINT16);

    GUID sublayerGuid;

    wfp::ObjectInstaller::AddSublayer(*engine, sublayer, &sublayerGuid);

    // Conditions are checked against the specified layer
    // To verify that they're compatible
    wfp::ConditionBuilder conditions(FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_CONNECT_V4);

    // Match on application
    conditions.add_condition(std::make_unique<wfp::conditions::ConditionApplication>( \
        L"c:\\windows\\system32\\svchost.exe"));

    // Match remote ports outside given range
    conditions.add_condition(wfp::conditions::ConditionPortRange::Remote( \
        0, 1023, wfp::conditions::CompareNeq()));

    wfp::FilterBuilder filter(wfp::BuilderValidation::OnlyCritical);

    filter
        .name(L"Svchost peer filter")
        .description(L"Block comms with remote services outside the well-known port range")
        .layer(FWPM_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_CONNECT_V4)
        .sublayer(sublayerGuid)
        .weight(wfp::FilterBuilder::WeightClass::Max)
        .block();

    wfp::ObjectInstaller::AddFilter(*engine, filter, conditions);

    //
    // <More code here>
    //

    return 0;
}
