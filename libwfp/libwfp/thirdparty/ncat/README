This is a portable (statically compiled) Win32 version of Ncat.  You
should be able to take the ncat.exe and run it on other systems
without having to also copy over a bunch of DLLs, etc.

More information on Ncat: http://nmap.org/ncat/

You can get the version number of this ncat by runnign "ncat
--version".  We don't create a new Ncat portable for each Ncat
release, so you will have to compile your own if you want a newer
version.  Instructions for doing so are available at:
https://secwiki.org/w/Nmap/Ncat_Portable

Ncat is distributed under the same free and open source license as
Nmap.  See http://nmap.org/book/man-legal.html.
